# Shows how to use a bit-reversed sequence for primary key generation.
#
# The TicketSale model uses a bit-reversed sequence for automatic primary key
# generation:
#
# id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(
#         BigInteger,
#         Sequence("ticket_sale_id"),
#         server_default=TextClause("GET_NEXT_SEQUENCE_VALUE(SEQUENCE ticket_sale_id)"),
#         primary_key=True,
#     )
#
# This leads to the following table definition:
#
# CREATE TABLE ticket_sales (
# 	id INT64 NOT NULL DEFAULT (GET_NEXT_SEQUENCE_VALUE(SEQUENCE ticket_sale_id)),
#   ...
# ) PRIMARY KEY (id)
