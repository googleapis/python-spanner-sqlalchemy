# Shows how INTERLEAVE IN PARENT can be used in SQLAlchemy.
# INTERLEAVE IN PARENT can be modelled as if it were a normal relationship
# in SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy can also generate the correct DDL for this.
#
# This sample uses the following table structure:
# CREATE TABLE albums (
# 	id STRING(36) NOT NULL,
# 	title STRING(200) NOT NULL,
# 	release_date DATE,
# 	singer_id STRING(36) NOT NULL,
# 	FOREIGN KEY(singer_id) REFERENCES singers (id)
# ) PRIMARY KEY (id);
#
# CREATE TABLE tracks (
# 	id STRING(36) NOT NULL,
# 	track_number INT64 NOT NULL,
# 	title STRING(200) NOT NULL,
# 	duration NUMERIC
# ) PRIMARY KEY (id, track_number),
# INTERLEAVE IN PARENT albums ON DELETE CASCADE
#
# See model.py for the full model definitions.
